## Scala CLI Commands

```bash
# Run tests
scala-cli test .

# Format code
scalafmt

# Compile
scala-cli compile .
```

## Glide Simulation Tests

Run the Glide2x test suite against the Verilator model:

```bash
make native/sim/run/test00      # single test
make native/sim/run-all         # all screenshot tests
TRACE=1 make native/sim/run/test00  # with FST waveform dump
```

Screenshots are saved to `output/<test>/screenshot.png`.

**Environment variables** (set at runtime):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SIM_FST` | Path for FST waveform output (requires `TRACE=1` build) |
| `SIM_CYCLE_LIMIT` | Max simulation ticks before clean exit (0 = unlimited) |
| `SIM_FBWRITE_LOG` | Path to log framebuffer writes |
| `SIM_TMU_LOG` | Path to log TMU/rasterizer activity |

## DOSBox-X (32-bit Glide Path)

The sim backend builds a **32-bit** `libglide2x`, so DOSBox-X must also be
32-bit to `dlopen()` it.

```bash
# Linux-hosted sim test
make native/sim/run/test00

# Linux-hosted trace capture
make native/trace/run/df00sim

# Build and run a DOS guest binary inside DOSBox-X through its built-in GLIDE2X.OVL
make dos/sim/run/df00sdk

# Headless DOS guest variant
make dos/sim/headless/df00sdk

# DOS guest with trace backend
make dos/trace/run/df00sdk

# Launch a raw DOSBox-X session with the sim Glide backend injected
make dos/dosbox
```

Common top-level commands:

- `make native/help` prints the Linux-hosted and trace command surface.
- `make native/sim/build` builds all Linux-hosted Glide test binaries.
- `make native/sim/build/<name>` builds one Linux-hosted test binary.
- `make native/sim/run/<name>` runs one Linux-hosted test and writes screenshot output under `output/`.
- `make native/trace/run/<name>` rebuilds the host Glide runtime with the trace harness and captures `traces/<name>.bin`.
- `make native/sim/check/<name>` replays an existing trace through the check pipeline.
- `make native/sim/test/<name>` captures and checks in one step.
- `make native/sim/check-all` replays every existing trace under `traces/`.
- `make dos/help` prints the DOS and Tomb command surface.
- `make dos/sim/build` builds all DOS SDK-style test binaries from `emu/glide/glide2x/sst1/glide/tests/Makefile.sdkwat`.
- `make dos/sim/build/<name>` builds one DOS SDK-style binary, for example `make dos/sim/build/df00sdk`.
- `make dos/sim/run/<name>` mounts `emu/glide/glide2x/sst1/glide/tests` as `C:` in DOSBox-X and runs `<name>.exe` with the sim backend.
- `make dos/sim/headless/<name>` does the same with `DOSBOXX32_HEADLESS=1`.
- `make dos/trace/run/<name>` runs a DOS guest against the trace-capture Glide runtime and writes `traces/dos/<name>.bin`.
- `make dos/trace/headless/<name>` does the same headlessly.
- `make dos/dosbox ARGS='...'` launches DOSBox-X with the sim Glide backend and forwards extra DOSBox-X arguments.
- `make tomb/help` prints the Tomb Raider setup requirements.
- `make tomb/prepare ARGS='--game-dir ... --patch ... --iso ...'` prepares a reusable Tomb Raider source tree from your game files and 3dfx patch assets.
- `make tomb/sim/run`, `make tomb/sim/headless`, and `make tomb/sim/capture` run Tomb Raider against the sim backend.
- `make tomb/sim/trace` runs Tomb Raider against the live sim runtime and also dumps a trace to `traces/tomb_live/trace.bin`.
- `make tomb/sim/trace/check` replays `traces/tomb_live/trace.bin` into `output/tomb/trace_replay_live/`.
- `make tomb/trace/run` and `make tomb/trace/headless` run Tomb Raider against the trace runtime and write `traces/tomb/trace.bin` automatically.
- `make tomb/trace/check` replays `traces/tomb/trace.bin` directly into `output/tomb/trace_replay/` without pulling in any stale `state.bin` from an old trace directory.

The hierarchy is intentional:

- `native/<runtime>/<action>[/<name>]` is for Linux-hosted test binaries.
- `dos/<runtime>/<action>[/<name>]` is for DOS guest binaries inside DOSBox-X.
- `tomb/<runtime>/<action>` is for Tomb Raider convenience flows.
- `de10/<action>` is for board-oriented workflows using the `de10` runtime.

Runtimes are explicit and non-stateful:

- `sim` means the normal in-process Verilator-backed Glide runtime.
- `trace` means the trace-capture Glide runtime.
- `de10` means the board/MMIO-backed Glide runtime.

In practice:

- `native/...` and `dos/...` currently expose `sim` and `trace` directly in the command path.
- `de10/...` keeps the runtime implicit in the namespace because every `de10` command already targets the board runtime.
- `SIM_INTERFACE=de10` is the closest host-side reproduction of the board interface: it still uses the `sim` runtime, but swaps the Verilated top-level from `CoreSim` to `CoreDe10` and drives the DE10-style MMIO plus Avalon memory ports from the host harness.

Examples:

```bash
make native/sim/run/test00 SIM_INTERFACE=de10
make dos/sim/run/df00sdk SIM_INTERFACE=de10
```

### Tomb Raider Setup

The Tomb helper scripts expect a prepared source tree at `DOSBOX_TOMB_SRC`.
By default that is `/tmp/tr1-3dfx`.

The easiest way to create it is:

```bash
make tomb/prepare ARGS='--game-dir /path/to/TOMBRAID --patch /path/to/3dfx-patch.zip --iso /path/to/tr1disc01.iso'
```

That helper:

- copies your source game directory into `DOSBOX_TOMB_SRC/TOMBRAID`
- copies the ISO into `DOSBOX_TOMB_SRC/tr1disc01.iso` if provided
- overlays the supplied 3dfx patch directory or archive onto the game directory

It accepts either a patch directory or a `.zip`/tar archive. Add `--output /path/to/tree`
to prepare somewhere other than `DOSBOX_TOMB_SRC`, and `--force` to replace an existing tree.

Expected layout by default:

```text
/tmp/tr1-3dfx/
  tr1disc01.iso
  TOMBRAID/
    TOMB.EXE
    ... game files ...
```

Typical flow:

- Prepare the tree with `make tomb/prepare ...`, or assemble the layout manually.
- Run `make tomb/help` to print the current assumptions.
- Run `make tomb/sim/run` or `make tomb/sim/headless`.

At launch time the helper scripts copy the source tree into `DOSBOX_TOMB_STAGE_ROOT`
(default `/tmp/tr1-run`) and automatically rename any bundled `glide2x.ovl` so that
DOSBox-X's built-in `GLIDE2X.OVL` guest bridge is used instead.

You can override the defaults with these environment variables:

- `DOSBOX_TOMB_SRC`
- `DOSBOX_TOMB_STAGE_ROOT`
- `DOSBOX_TOMB_GAME_DIR`
- `DOSBOX_TOMB_ISO`
- `DOSBOX_TOMB_EXE`

Notes:

- `scripts/run-dosboxx32-glide` prefers `DOSBOXX32_BIN` if set.
- If `dosbox-x` on `PATH` is already 32-bit, it uses that.
- Otherwise it auto-resolves Nix `pkgsi686Linux.dosbox-x`.
- The script appends `scripts/dosboxx32-glide.conf` (enables `glide=true`, `voodoo_card=false`, `lfb=full_noaux`).
- For low-level manual control you can still use `scripts/run-dosboxx32-glide` directly.

## Trace-Based Testing

Glide trace files (`.bin`) capture PCI bus operations for offline replay against both
the RTL simulation and a software reference model:

```bash
# Capture a trace from a Linux-hosted test
make native/trace/run/test_alphabet

# Replay one trace through the reference model and RTL simulator
make native/sim/check/test_alphabet

# Capture and replay in one step
make native/sim/test/test_alphabet

# Replay every existing trace
make native/sim/check-all
```

Replay outputs are written to `test-output/<trace>/` as `<trace>_ref.png`, `<trace>_sim.png`, and `<trace>_diff.png`.

Trace files are stored in `traces/` and compared pixel-by-pixel against a reference model.

## DE10-Nano

The DE10-Nano flow is meant for three practical tasks:

- generate FPGA-ready RTL and bitstreams
- program or deploy a board
- run workloads on real hardware

Common commands:

```bash
make de10/help

# Generate RTL / FPGA build inputs
make de10/rtl
make de10/qsys
make de10/bitstream

# Program or deploy to the default board (fpga@debian-fpga.local)
make de10/setup/program
make de10/setup/deploy

# Basic board validation
make de10/check/mmio

# Run workloads on hardware
make de10/run/dos/df00sdk
make de10/run/tomb
```

Useful defaults and assumptions:

- Default board target is `fpga@debian-fpga.local` unless `DE10_HOST` or `DE10_USER` override it.
- Default deployed runtime prefix is `/home/fpga/spinalvoodoo` unless `DE10_REMOTE_PREFIX` overrides it.
- `make de10/run/dos/<name>` uses the deployed launcher on the board and mounts `DE10_RUNTIME_DIR` (default `/home/fpga/de10-cross`) as `C:`.
- `make de10/run/tomb` expects a prepared remote Tomb tree at `DE10_TOMB_SRC` (default `/home/fpga/tr1-3dfx`) containing the game directory and ISO.

Extra DE10 helpers live in `scripts/` and `tools/` for board capture, replay, and bring-up.
